An example project to show how to use Phantom deeplinks to login and use Solana NFTs in Unity games and apps.

Follow me on Twitter for more frequent updates: @SolPlay_jonas

1) To use it in your game just include: 
https://github.com/Woody4618/Solana.Unity-SDK.git (maybe a few commits ahead or behind the garbles SDK) 
or 
https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK.git
in your unity package manager.

2) Import this unity package 
[SolPlay_0_4_alpha.unitypackage.zip](https://github.com/Woody4618/SolanaUnityDeeplinkExample/files/9880685/SolPlay_0_4_alpha.unitypackage.zip)
Or get the newest Unity package from the Releases tab on the right.
and then import it in Unity Assets->importPackage.


Here is a Video which explains the process step by step:
